# A/B Testing for Marketing Campaigns

This project analyzes the performance of two marketing campaigns (Control and Test) using A/B testing. The analysis compares key metrics like spend, impressions, website clicks, and purchases to determine the effectiveness of each campaign.

## Datasets

- **Control Group:** Data from the control campaign.
- **Test Group:** Data from the test campaign.

Both datasets include the following columns:
- `Campaign Name`
- `Date`
- `Spend [USD]`
- `# of Impressions`
- `Reach`
- `# of Website Clicks`
- `# of Searches`
- `# of View Content`
- `# of Add to Cart`
- `# of Purchase`

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Convert date columns and handle missing values.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for both control and test campaigns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations of key metrics, such as spend, clicks, and purchases.

For example, you can view the spend distribution plot below. This graph shows the distribution of advertising spend for both the control and test groups. It's useful for understanding the differences in spend distribution between the two campaigns.

5. **A/B Testing**: T-tests for statistical comparison of metrics between control and test campaigns.
6. **ROI and Conversion Rates**: Calculation of conversion rates and return on investment (ROI).
7. **Final Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, the script outputs the more effective campaign.
